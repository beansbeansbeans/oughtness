        <p>Oughtness is a tool for prioritizing causes through crowdsourcing. The site is inspired by the <a href="http://gif.gf/" target="_blank">GifGif</a> and <a href="http://pulse.media.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Place Pulse</a> projects.</p>
        <p>Users compare two causes at a time in terms of their criticalness or tractability. The <a href="./data">data</a> page shows the causes ranked by priority based on all the votes collected on the site.</p>

      <div class="detail">
        <p>We hope our data can contribute to research on cause prioritization - a field concerned with the question of where humanity should apply its resources in order to achieve the greatest positive impact. Traditionally, researchers generate independent estimates of cause priority in order to answer this question. By contrast, we ask users to make head-to-head comparisons between causes. There is <a href="http://rationalaltruist.com/2013/04/28/estimates-vs-head-to-head-comparisons/" target="_blank">evidence</a> that the latter approach to determining priority may have certain advantages.</p>

      <div class="title">Methodology</div>
      <div class="detail">
        <p>Our methods are heavily influenced by <a href="http://www.givewell.org/" target="_blank">GiveWell</a>, a charity research organization. The twelve causes presented on the site are from their <a href="http://blog.givewell.org/2014/05/22/narrowing-down-u-s-policy-areas/" target="_blank">list</a> of policy areas most worthy of greater investment, and criticalness and tractability are two criteria from their <a href="https://80000hours.org/2013/12/a-framework-for-strategically-selecting-a-cause/" target="_blank">framework</a> for evaluating causes.</p>
        <p>In order to derive overall rankings for causes from pairwise comparisons, we made use of the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The AHP is a widely used technique for making complex decisions involving multiple alternatives and criteria.
